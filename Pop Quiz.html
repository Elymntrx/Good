            <h2>Understanding Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.</p>
            <p>The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.</p>

            <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
            <p>Every action, no matter how small, contributes to the larger effort. Consider reducing your carbon footprint by using public transport, saving energy at home, consuming less, and supporting sustainable businesses.</p>
